# WUI (Window User Interface Library)

WUI is a cross-platform modern C++ library for creating graphical user interfaces. The library uses C++17 and has a minimalistic API. Currently it supports Windows (XP - 11) and Linux (glibc 2.23 and above).

WUI is designed to provide developers with a simple and efficient tool for creating cross-platform GUI applications in C++. The library allows focusing on application logic rather than platform-specific interface implementation details.

## Features

- Cross-platform: supports Windows and Linux, with macOS planned
- Minimalistic API, ease of use
- Common interfaces for drawing and event handling, platform-independent
- Support for themes and localization
- Ability to create and integrate custom controls
- Application configuration management (Windows registry, ini files, JSON)

## Architecture

The project is based on three key entities:

- **Window** — a window that receives system events and manages controls
- **Control** — a visual interface element (buttons, input fields, etc.)
- **Graphic** — an interface for rendering, abstracting platform-dependent drawing methods
